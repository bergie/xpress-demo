NoFlo Express demo app
======================

Simple demo app, originally made for [the Berlin Node.js meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Node-js-Meetup-Berlin/events/238051786/).

Showcases [noflo-xpress](https://github.com/noflo/noflo-xpress) resourceful routing together with concepts like:

* Express-wide middleware (body parser)
* Route-specific middleware (JSON schema validator)
* Passing work to regular NoFlo components and handling results of that
